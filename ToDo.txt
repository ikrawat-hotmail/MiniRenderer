Separate out collider and actual polygon geometery

Update modelLoader.cpp to parse the collision boxes as well from json


workflow be like-

1. decide on directory for a scene
2. load rigidbodies
3. load colliders for each rigid body (go side by side in parser)
4. setup opengl pipeline
5. for each rigid body go internally and form an array of vertices
6. load these array in VBO and VAO
7. run render loop
    8. on each sync signal
    9. animate rigid body
    10. detect collider
